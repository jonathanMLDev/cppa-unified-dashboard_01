# RAG-Powered Mailing List Intelligence System for Boost Website

## Feature Categories by Data Source

### Library-Related Features (Heavy RAG Use)

**Source**: Mailing list archives analyzed by RAG  
**Features**: Items 1-11 below - core value proposition of RAG system

All features extract information from mailing list archives using RAG queries and email processing pipelines.

### Common Processing Pipeline

**1. Retrieval Stage** (Metadata-Based Filtering + Semantic Search):

- **Temporal Filter**: Query vector DB using email metadata (NOT content search)
  - Email date field: `WHERE email.date >= start_date AND email.date <= end_date`
  - For release-based queries: `WHERE email.date >= release_X.date AND email.date < release_Y.date`
  - Store release dates in separate table for filtering
- **Library Filter**: Match library name in subject/body or use metadata tag
- **Semantic Search**: Query embeddings with natural language (e.g., "bug reports", "architectural decisions")
  - Embeddings capture semantic meaning
  - Optional: Exact match filter for specific terms (e.g., CVE IDs, API names) when precision required
- Rank by semantic relevance score and recency
- Return individual emails (no thread reconstruction needed)

**2. Classification/Extraction**:

- **Sentiment Analysis** (Items 1-3): Classify email sentiment/tone
- **Content Categorization**: Bug reports, features, decisions, etc.
- **Information Extraction**: Who, what, when, why, decisions, blockers
- Validate against criteria (maintainer participation, consensus, etc.)

**3. Summary Generation**:

- **Summarization Model** (Items 1-3): Generate concise thread summaries
- **RAG Generation** (Items 4-9): Detailed structured content
- Generate bullet points or formatted summaries
- Link to source threads (transparency requirement)
- Add confidence indicators and sentiment labels

**4. Review Workflow**:

- Low-risk: Auto-publish (e.g., weekly summaries)
- Medium-risk: Flag for maintainer review (e.g., deprecations)
- High-risk: Mandatory approval (e.g., security, migrations)

### 1~3. Discussion Summaries (Temporal)

**Purpose**: Provide current and historical view of library discussions

**Three Views**:

1. **Last 7 Days**: Real-time pulse, auto-updated daily
2. **Since Last Release**: Release cycle overview, updated continuously
3. **Previous Releases**: Historical archive with final outcomes

**Sample RAG Retrieval Query**:

```
"Show all discussions about Boost.Beast in the last 7 days, including bug reports,
feature requests, and design discussions"
```

**Sample Summarization Prompt**:

```
Categorize emails (Bug/Feature/Design/Performance/Docs/Build), provide 2-3 sentence
summary per topic, identify sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative/Urgent/Blocked),
extract participants and status, highlight critical issues. Output as JSON.
```

**Processing**:

- **Temporal filtering** (metadata-based, not content search):
  - Item 1 (Last 7 Days): `email.date >= (current_date - 7 days)`
  - Item 2 (Since Release): `email.date >= last_release.date AND email.date < next_release.date`
  - Item 3 (Previous Release): `email.date >= release_X.date AND email.date < release_X+1.date`
  - Requires: Release date table with version → date mapping
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Apply sentiment classifier to each email
  - Classify: Positive, Neutral, Negative, Urgent, Blocked
  - Track sentiment trends: e.g., "3 frustrated users reporting bug", "maintainer positive about proposal"
  - Flag issues with negative sentiment spikes
- **Content Categorization**: Bug Reports, Features, Design, Performance, Documentation, Build Issues
- **Summarization**: Apply summarization model to retrieved emails and cluster by topic
- Track: email count, participants, maintainer responses, resolution status, sentiment distribution
- Priority scoring: maintainer participation (+3), security (+5), breaking change (+4), participants (+0.5 each), negative sentiment (+1)

**Output**: Categorized summaries with activity metrics, sentiment indicators, priority ordering, and source links

**Automation**: Items 1-2 run daily; Item 3 is archival
